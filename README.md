## Descriptive Analysis
Descriptive analysis is a data analysis technique that aims to describe and summarize the characteristics and patterns of the data. It is an important step in data analysis as it allows the analyst to have an overview of the data and better understand what is being analyzed before moving on to more complex analyses.

Descriptive analysis usually involves the use of statistical measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance to summarize the data and identify trends and patterns. In addition, graphs and tables are also often used to visualize and communicate the results of descriptive analysis.

## DataSet used
The dataset provided by Data Science Academy consists of 150 observations and six variables: year, model, price, mileage, color, and transmission type.

The "year" variable refers to the year of manufacture of the vehicle, while the "model" variable indicates the model of the vehicle. The "price" variable indicates the selling price of the vehicle, while the "mileage" variable indicates the mileage traveled by the vehicle. The "color" variable indicates the color of the vehicle and the "transmission type" variable indicates whether the vehicle has a manual or automatic transmission.
