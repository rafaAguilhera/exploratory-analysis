library(ggplot2)


# Library "e1071" is an R library that provides various functions for statistical and machine learning tasks, including classification, 
# clustering, and probability distributions. It includes popular functions such as "svm()" for support vector machines, "naiveBayes()" 
#for naive Bayes classifiers, and "kmeans()" for k-means clustering. It also includes functions for calculating various measures of 
# association, such as mutual information and chi-squared statistics. The library is widely used in data science, machine learning, 
# and predictive modeling.


# The ggplot2 library is a data visualization library for the R programming language. It is an implementation of the Grammar of Graphics, 
# which is a general scheme for creating statistical graphics. The library provides a high-level declarative syntax for creating a wide 
# variety of plots, including scatter plots, line plots, bar plots, histograms, and more.

# One of the key features of ggplot2 is its ability to easily overlay different types of data and visual elements. This allows users to
# create complex and multi-layered plots that can convey a lot of information in a clear and concise manner.

# In addition to its powerful plotting capabilities, ggplot2 also provides several tools for customizing the appearance of plots. 
# This includes options for controlling the color, size, and shape of plotted elements, as well as the ability to add labels, 
# annotations, and other text elements to plots.

# ggplot2 is widely used in data science and data visualization and has a large and active community of users and developers. 
# It is considered one of the most powerful and flexible data visualization libraries for R.
